                <p>
                  After thoroughly analyzing the client's requirements during previous software development life cycle stages, 
                  the developers design several product architectures and present them to the client.
                  The chosen architecture is then finalized in a Design Document Specification (DDS), which is reviewed by all parties in terms of risks, 
                  operational reliability, universality, and cost-effectiveness. 
                  This architecture becomes the foundation for all next stages of software development life cycle and the software product in question.

                  This stage includes the development of detailed designs that brings initial design work into a completed form of specifications. 
                  This work includes the specification of interfaces between the system and its intended environment, and a comprehensive evaluation of the systems logistical, 
                  maintenance and support requirements. The detail design and development is responsible for producing the product, 
                  process and material specifications and may result in substantial changes to the development specification.
