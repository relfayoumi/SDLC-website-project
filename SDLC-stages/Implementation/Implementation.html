                  This is one of the most critical phases of the software development life cycle, with the goal of producing working code and demonstrating results to the client. 
                  The majority of a project's time is spent on development.  
                  Sometimes the project takes longer than expected: the client may consider expanding the project scope during the development phase. 
                  Some SDLC models allow the product to change during development.
                </p>

                  During the production and/or construction stage, the product is built or assembled in accordance with the product, process, and material specifications, 
                  and then deployed and tested in the operational target environment. 
                  System assessments are carried out to correct deficiencies and adapt the system for ongoing improvement.

                <p>
                  This stage includes the creation of detailed designs that transform the initial design work into a complete set of specifications. 
                  This work includes specifying interfaces between the system and its intended environment, as well as conducting a thorough evaluation of the system's logistical, 
                  maintenance, and support requirements. The detail design and development team is in charge of creating the product, process, and material specifications, 
                  which may result in significant changes to the development specification.
