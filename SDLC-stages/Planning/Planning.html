                  SDLC stages - Planning
                </h2>
                <p>
                  At the beginning of the software development life cycle stages,
                  the need for recruiting the most skilled and experienced developers
                  becomes clear. A skilled group of developers can provide a solid foundation 
                  for the next stages of the software development life cycle by taking the client's 
                  requirements into consideration.
                  
                  There are several crucial milestones at this stage. The project team first gathers 
                  preliminary data to identify the goals and concerns of their customer. They provide a 
                  list of possible solutions along with the estimated price for every option based on their results.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The planning stage (also known as the feasibility stage) is exactly what it sounds like: a phase in which developers plan for the upcoming project.
                  It helps in defining the problem and scope of any existing systems, as well as determining the objectives for their new systems.
                  By creating a successful plan for the upcoming development cycle, they should be able to identify problems before they impact development.
                  Also, we support them in obtaining the funding and resources required to carry out their plan.
                  Perhaps most importantly, the planning stage establishes the project schedule, which is essential if the development is for a commercial product that must be released to the market by a specific deadline.

                  Importance of Planning
                </h2>
                <p>
                  The planning stage organizes the software development process, 
                  breaks it down into manageable tasks, 
                  and assigns those tasks to specific team members, 
                  ensuring that everyone understands their roles.
                  The rest of the project will make no sense unless the overall scope is properly defined. 
                  This phase involves conducting research on the resources required, the personnel who will work on the project, the budget,
                   and pretty much everything else that needs to be done to determine the scope of the project.
