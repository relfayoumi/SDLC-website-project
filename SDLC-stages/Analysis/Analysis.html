            SDLC stages - Analysis
          </h2>
          <p>
            Following the client's selection of a software solution, the software development life cycle stages continue with a thorough examination of the requirements.
             The team reviews project-related documents and evaluates the client's current ecosystem. 
            This is one of the software development life cycle steps that some consider transitional, taking place alongside planning and requirements analysis.
          </p>
          <p>
            This phase is critical for transforming the information gathered during the planning and analysis stages into specific requirements for the development team. 
            This process guides the creation of several key documents, including a software requirement specification (SRS) or product specification, a Use Case document, 
            and a Requirement Traceability Matrix document.
          </p>
          <h2>
            Importance of Analysis
          </h2>
          <p>
            System analysis identifies areas where businesses can benefit from software solutions.
             Consultants identify gaps and errors in current processes, which interfere with productivity.
              They evaluate the need for automation, integration, or customization to improve operations. 
              System analysts lay the groundwork for the development of software solutions that meet specific business requirements.
          </p>
          <p>
            The core of system analysis is a thorough understanding of a company's business processes, workflows, and objectives.
             By analyzing these issues, business consultants gain insights into areas that can be optimized and improved.
              They identify bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and pain points in the current systems, paving the way for improvement.
          </p>
