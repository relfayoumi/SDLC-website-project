              Summary of the SDLC life cycle stages
            </h2>
            <p>
              The software development lifecycle (SDLC) is the cost-effective and time-efficient process that development teams use to design and build high-quality software. 
              The goal of SDLC is to minimize project risks through forward planning so that software meets customer expectations during production and beyond.
              This methodology outlines a series of steps that divide the software development process into tasks you can assign, complete, and measure.
            </p>
            <p>
              Software development can be challenging to manage due to changing requirements, technology upgrades, and cross-functional collaboration. 
              The software development lifecycle (SDLC) methodology provides a systematic management framework with specific deliverables at every stage of the software development process. 
              As a result, all stakeholders agree on software development goals and requirements upfront and also have a plan to achieve those goals.
